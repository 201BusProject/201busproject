# 201BusProject

In early 2020, the pandemic-induced lockdown brought Bangalore to a halt. In order to stay in touch with the movement of the city, we began the 201 Bus Project. We travelled on the popular 201 Bus Route and recorded what we saw and heard. We compiled these in a sound map and an album. Here, you can listen to people talking, buses creaking and the traffic (in case you missed that at home!). It might help you navigate the boundaries between the personal and the shared, the familiar and the unfamiliar. We hope this creates a sense of togetherness as we are apart.

Please contact us, if you want to contribute to this website. You can help us map the movement of Bangalore. You can send us photos, illustrations, sound recordings or anything else that you think captures the vibrancy of the city. Additionally, you can help us develop this website. For this, you need the instructions below.
